<h1><b>Purpose of this project</b></h1>

The purpose of this project is for me to learn some C++.<br>
I have dabbled in Python & C# in the past, but have never actually commited to start a project on my own.<br>
What better way of learning a programming language than to apply it to something you like and love, for a better learning effect?<br>
In my case that is gaming and the game "Path of Exile".<br>
<br>
As many people know, the devs are not too fond of QoL features (That has somehow changed in the recent past, for the better), and crafting can be painful, especially when you plan on doing something like profit crafting.<br>
So, to make that whole process a bit easier for myself and learning something at the same time, I decided to start this project.<br>

<h3>Be aware that (for now) it is not planned for me to take feature requests, give support for problems you may encounter, etc. <br>
This may change in the future, but for now this project is simply for myself.</h3>

<h1><b>Features planned for now</b></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Basic crafting (Alt/Essence spamming)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>To start simple, this will be done via image recognition and working with clipboard contents. I am interested in learning how to interact with process memory, however I do not want to overcomplicate everything for now, or deal with updating pointers every league, Anti-Cheat, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Currency Exchange rate checker</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Because of some random video I found, it seems like arbitrage with items on the Currency Exchange is quite profitable (When you have enough gold at hand). This will be done via image recognition as well, lets see how that goes..</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
